## Handlebars.js

Create dynamic web pages with **handlebars.js** library.

Library is a collection of code that has been written that makes development easier. With **Handlebars**, you are provided a templating engine which allows you to generate reusable HTML with Javascript.

Another benefit is that Handlebars keeps a clear separation of when you're writing HTML or JavaScript.

Invitations are a great example of a “real life” template. Invitation cards usually include the invitee's name, the venue location, the time and date, and maybe a short description. If you had to write all of that information out, then you would realize that most of the information is repeated — the only change you really need to make is the name! Creating a template with a blank space for the name would make it much easier for you to invite all your friends and family!
